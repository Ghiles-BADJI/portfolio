    "about.paragraph1": "From 2014 to 2021, I had a first life in accounting during which I put my financial expertise at the service of my merchant and artisan clients. I really liked meeting their legal needs, but I quickly saw the limits of technical accounting evolution. Surrounded by developers, I was naturally interested in computer technology.",
    "about.paragraph2": "In 2021, I decided to put an end to my accounting career to train myself in software development. I started by cramming on theoretical sites and very quickly I started creating sites. In this process I was accompanied by my father, and my two brothers, all three passionate and experts in development / architecture.",
    "about.paragraph3": "Thanks to the sites that I implemented and on which I had a lot of fun, I practiced several languages. The ones that I particularly liked and for which I deepened my knowledge are JavaScript, Typescript and C#.",
